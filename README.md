# Chinese_checkers

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

This repo is an example of chinese checkers in Racket. It doesnÂ´t implement any Min-Max algorithm, but you can play against the computer, it uses the backtracking to get the best posible move. It doesn't evaluate the other player best move (just to block or defend), it only attack.
